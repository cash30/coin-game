this is a short platformer style game where you are a coin and mario is trying to collect you. there isnt really a way to win and i do recegnise that it is probably going to be considered a low quality project. 
there is only one level and its not very good cuz i didnt have a lot of time. i dont expect many coins from it but it'l get me to week 2.
(also cut me some slack this is my first godot project and my first hack club priject)
